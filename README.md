## Notes

The rrt_connect_line.py implementation should be done, but I'm not sure if it's perfect.
I plan on implementing the variant where you delete the branch if there's a collision, and I've been 
thinking about modifying the probability of how random points are chosen.

EDIT: I've implemented the delete branch variant, but I think my implementation isn't good for runtime, so I won't include it here for now.
